# Audio Processing

This folder contains Python scripts for various audio processing tasks, including recording audio, manipulating audio files, visualizing audio signals, and working with WAV file parameters. Below is a description of each file and its functionality.

## Files

### 1. `mp3audio.py`
This script demonstrates how to process audio files using the `pydub` library. It performs the following tasks:
- Loads a WAV file (`Recording.wav`).
- Increases the volume by 6dB and doubles the volume.
- Applies a 2-second fade-in effect.
- Exports the processed audio to an MP3 file (`output.mp3`).
- Reloads the MP3 file for further processing.

### 2. `mic_audio.py`
This script records audio from the microphone and saves it as a WAV file. Key features include:
- Uses the `pyaudio` library to handle audio streams.
- Records 5 seconds of audio in mono format with a sampling rate of 16 kHz.
- Saves the recorded audio to `output.wav`.

### 3. `ploting_audio.py`
This script visualizes the waveform of an audio file. It includes:
- Reading a WAV file (`Recording.wav`) using the `wave` library.
- Extracting audio parameters such as sample rate, number of frames, and channels.
- Converting stereo audio to mono if necessary.
- Plotting the audio signal waveform using `matplotlib`.

### 4. `wave_library.py`
This script demonstrates how to work with WAV files using the `wave` library. It performs the following:
- Reads and displays parameters of an existing WAV file (`Recording.wav`), such as channels, sample width, frame rate, and duration.
- Creates a new WAV file (`new_Recording.wav`) with modified parameters (e.g., mono channel, different frame rate).
- Copies the audio frames from the original file to the new file.

## Audio Files
- `Recording.wav`: A sample WAV file used as input for processing and visualization.
- `output.wav`: The output file generated by `mic_audio.py` after recording audio.
- `output.mp3`: The processed MP3 file generated by `mp3audio.py`.
- `new_Recording.wav`: A new WAV file created by `wave_library.py` with modified parameters.

## Requirements
To run the scripts, you need the following Python libraries:
- `pydub`
- `pyaudio`
- `wave`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pydub pyaudio numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Place the required audio files (`Recording.wav`) in the same directory as the scripts.
2. Run the desired script using Python:
   ```bash
   python <script_name>.py
   ```
3. Check the output files or visualizations generated by the scripts.

## Notes
- Ensure that the `ffmpeg` or `libav` library is installed for `pydub` to handle MP3 files.
- The microphone recording script (`mic_audio.py`) requires microphone access on your system.
